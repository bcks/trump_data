# Gitmo Camp

A small hand-curated CSV tracking the population of the [concentration
camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_camp) established by the Trump
administration in Guantanamo Bay.

## Context

This data is being sourced from different news sources and press releases and
there is no official data source for it yet. This means there will likely be
errors and distortion. Do not confuse any precision in these numbers for
accuracy!

## Data
This is a simple CSV that I will update manually over time with the following columns:
- date (in ISO format)
- delta (change from prior)
- population (int)
- source (a link to a source URL)
