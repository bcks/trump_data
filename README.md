# Trump Data

This is a repository for collecting various specific datasets that track some
indicator of how America is being affected by Trump's second presidency. Some of
these might just be simple hand-edited CSVs, while for others might be scraped.
This is not the only source of data out there, but it's mine.

# Data Sets
- Gitmo Camp - tracking the population of the concentration camp in Guantanamo Bay
- Home Visits - tracking whenever Trump visits one of his various properties
- Executive Order Litigation Tracker - scrapes the Judicial Watch website to convert it into JSON
- IT Modernization - an attempt to track the DOGE infiltration of various agencies under the guise of IT modernization
- Unemployment Claims - the weekly unemployment insurance claims, which includes federal staff
